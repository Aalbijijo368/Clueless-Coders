# Clueless-Coders
We're developing a hospital system to schedule appointments. It finds when doctors are free and gets you a slot based on wait times. Less waiting, more help
# Hospital Appointment Scheduling System

This project aims to revolutionize hospital appointment scheduling through the integration of advanced technologies and AI-driven algorithms. The system automates appointment scheduling using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the front-end interface, while a Python script handles backend operations.

## Features:
- Cutting-edge Technology: Utilizes RFID, face detection, and mobile proximity sensing.
- AI-driven Algorithms: Dynamically allocates appointment slots based on doctor availability and patient demand.
- Reduced Wait Times: Significantly reduces patient wait times, enhancing overall efficiency.
- Improved Patient Experience: Ensures minimized wait times and enhanced convenience for patients.

## Technologies Used:
- Front-end: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Back-end: Python

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Open the project directory and run the Python script for the backend.
4. Open the HTML file in your preferred web browser to access the front-end interface.
5. Start scheduling appointments efficiently!
